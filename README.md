I promise I did this exercise on my own!

For adding multiply to the calculator we need to do few things:
1. Add it to the logic part in SimpleCalculatorImpl.java - function that inserts multiply as "*".
2. Change accordingly the equals part, especially rules of calcultion (multipication before minus or plus).
3. Add it to the UI part in MainActivity, and also add button to the xml file.
4. Add more test using multipy in the logical part and also in the UI part.
